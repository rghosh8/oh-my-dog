### Abstract

This capstone uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate realistic dog images from the training data. 

### Objective

* Complete GAN model

How GAN works?

* generateor receives a random seed as input
* the seed is used to produce output
* discriminator then is used to classify real images (drawn from the training set) from fake images (produced by the generator)
* losses are calculated for each of the models
* gradients are used to update the generator and discriminator
